# Introduction

This is a simple vim configuration that adds a few very useful plugins with
simple initial configuration. It also shows how to include some separated
personal configurations in a `personal` folder, and it includes a couple of
nice plugins, see `personal/plugin`.

## Installation

If you want to try this, you can do this:

```sh
# If necessary:
mv ~/.vim ~/.vim_old
mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc_old

# Clone dotvim-simple
git clone https://github.com/lervag/dotvim-simple ~/.vim

# Install python-neovim, e.g.
sudo pip install --user neovim

# Start Vim, let it install plugins and quit
vim

# Now edit as desired...
vim
```
